    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      OVI should represent a system able to model and manage the knowledge about the provenance of each video resource
      available online. This techincal report describes our final considerations, after developing our solution, the
      progress we made and some more in-depth information on what we managed to do.

      <h3>Search Service</h3>

      <img width="100%" height="120%" src="images/searchServiceClassDiagram.svg">

      <p>
        As initially designed, search service handles all operations related to searching, that is querying our dataset
        and also querying <a href="https://www.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>. Compared to the initial considerations for
        this service, tree more endpoints have been added, totaling to five:
      </p>
      <section id="getMovieTitles">
        <h4>/movies/titles/{title}</h4>
        <p>
          The first endpoint, "/movies/titles/{title}", will be used whenever an user searches for a movie by its title
          or only part of it (e.g. "The Lord of the Rings" or just "lord" or "ring"). When this happens, a GET request
          will be made, our dataset will be queried agains and all matching titles will be returned, along with their
          URI. The titles will be displayed as a list for the user to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          This information is obtaiend by constructing and running the following query:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            SELECT  ?movie (GROUP_CONCAT(distinct ?name; SEPARATOR = "|separator|") as ?name) 
            WHERE {
              ?movie a resources:Movie .
              ?movie resources:title ?name .
              FILTER( regex(lcase(str(?name)), "title") )      
            } GROUP BY  ?movie
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          What this query does is quite simple, we search for entities that are of type <b>resource:Movie</b>, getting
          their URI, along with their name. The reason why the names are grouped is due to the existence of movies that
          have multiple titles, be them translations in other languages or other variations. For <b>GROUP_CONCAT</b> we
          try to use a separator that is as unique as possible, since titles may contain symbols such as commas, colons
          or semicolons.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="getMovieData">
        <h4>/movies/data/{movieUri}</h4>
        <p>
          When the user clicks on one of the titles from the list, another GET request will be made, this time to the
          "/movies/data/{movieUri}" endpoint, which will return all properties of said title. This is done by using the
          following query:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            SELECT  ?movie ?prop  
            (GROUP_CONCAT(distinct ?name; SEPARATOR = "|separator|") as ?name) 
            (GROUP_CONCAT(distinct ?value; SEPARATOR = "|separator|") as ?value) 
            WHERE {
              ?movie a resources:Movie .
              ?movie resources:title ?name .
              FILTER(?movie = (<uri>))
              ?movie ?prop ?value.
              FILTER(( ?prop not in (rdf:type)))
            } GROUP BY  ?movie ?prop
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This query does not differ much from the previous one, the additions being the presence of the variables ?prop
          and ?value and, of course, the triple and filter they are used in. The triple <b>?movie ?prop ?value</b> will
          return all properties and their values for our movie, of which we exclude the <b>rdf:type</b> property. The
          results from this endpoint will contain as well the values that will be displayed for the user, along with
          their URI, where we can consider them (an actor may have an URI, but the same can not be said about runtime,
          the duration of the movie.)
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="getMovieDataDbpedia">
        <h4>/dbpedia/movies/{title}</h4>
        <p>
          In the event that an user searches for a title that is not in our dataset, then he may choose to search for it
          in an external source, DBpedia, by calling this endpoint. This call will directly return the information about
          a movie, based on its title, requiring the user to be more precise about the information he wishes to
          visualize.
        </p>
        <p>
          To get the information from DBpedia, the following query is used:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            SELECT  ?movie ?prop  (GROUP_CONCAT(distinct ?value; SEPARATOR = "|separator|") as ?value) 
            WHERE {
              { 
                SELECT  distinct ?movie  
                WHERE {
                  ?movie a dbo:Film .
                  ?movie a schema:CreativeWork .
                  ?movie dbp:director ?director .
                  ?movie dbp:language ?language .
                  ?movie dbp:starring ?starring .
                  ?movie dbp:name ?name .
                  FILTER( regex(lcase(str(?name)), "title") )
                } LIMIT 10
              }
              ?movie ?prop ?value.
              FILTER(?prop not in (rdf:type))
            } 
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          We can see it as being an outer query and an inner query. The inner query returns the URIs of movies in
          DBpedia, by making sure they are of type dbo:Film and schema:CreativeWork, then also by checking that they
          have a minimum of requried fields in order for us to be able to display some information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the URIs obtained as a result from the inner query, we can then take all properties of the movies, aside
          from <b>rdf:type</b> and they will be sent to the graphical interface, where the relevant information will be
          displayed for the user to see.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="getPersonsData">
        <h4>/dbpedia/persons/{name}</h4>
        <p>
          In the movie information that will be displayed for the user, there will also be persons of interests, such as
          directors, writers and actors. In case that the user wants to find out more about them, a call to this
          endpoint will be made.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>          
            SELECT ?person ?prop 
            (GROUP_CONCAT(distinct ?value; SEPARATOR = "|separator|") as ?value) 
            WHERE {
              { 
                SELECT  distinct ?person  
                WHERE {
                  ?person a dbo:Person .
                  ?person dbp:name ?name .
                  FILTER( regex(lcase(str(?name)), "name") )
                } LIMIT 10
              }
              ?person ?prop ?value.
              FILTER(?prop not in (rdf:type))
            } 
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Similarly to the previous endpoint we talked about, here we also have an outer query and an inner query. The
          inner query returns all entitties of the type <b>dbo:Person</b> and then, using the URI provided by it, the
          outer query will get all properties for a person.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="getAllNodes">
        <h4>/resource/{resourceUri}</h4>
        <p>
          This endpoint is called whenever an user clicks on one of the links displayed on the movie's page, with the
          exception of movies in the recommended section. All information reagarding the resource will be returned by
          quering against our dataset, checking for cases where the URI of the resource appears as any one of the
          subject, predicate and/or object of the triple.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>         
            SELECT  ?subject ?predicate ?object  
            WHERE {
              ?subject ?predicate ?object.
              FILTER( ?subject = <resourceUri> || ?predicate = <resourceUri> || ?object = <resourceUri> )

      <h3>Dataset Initialization Service</h3>

      <img height="100%" width="100%" src="images/datasetInitializationServiceClassDiagram.svg">

      <p>
        This service only has one endpoint and its purpose is to populate our dataset. In other words, the process of
        gathering data, processing it and then inserting said data into our dataset takes place here. This service will
        not be available for the users to make calls to.
      </p>
      <p>
        To gather data, we query against DBpedia's own SPARQL endpoint. The query that we use for this is similar to the
        one used in the <a href="#getMovieDataDbpedia">Search Service</a>, on the endpoint that gets data from dbpedia,
        as such we will not be displaying it again here. The information return by such a query will then be processed
        such that we could add it into our own dataset. This would mainly include parsing through the results, decoding
        and encoding values, where needed and arranging them into triples that would then be inserted.

      <h3>Recommandation Service</h3>
      <img height="100%" width="100%" src="images/recommendationServiceClassDiagram.svg">
      <p>
        This service will be called when an user wishes to get recomandation based on a movie he is currently
        visualising. It only has one endpoint, <b>/recommend</b> which receives a GET requesnt and it will take its
        parameters from the query string. The parameters it can take are the URI of the movie that the recommendation is
        made for, the URIs of the actors also those of the directors and the genre. Note that the URIs will be url
        encoded.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service queries our dataset for movies different from the one given as parameter, that have at least one
        actor or one director or can be included in one of the genres from the list of parameters given. It then
        processes the result and sends it back to the party that made the request.

    <section id="queryBuilderLibrary">
      <h3>Query Builder Library</h3>
      <img height="100%" width="100%" src="images/queryBuilderLibraryClassDiagram.svg">
      <p>
        To ease the process of building queries in code, we constructed a library that would help us in this regard.
        Currently, this library has classes that support building select queries and insert queries only, as they were
        the only types of queries used in our project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <b>QueryBuilder</b> class has <b>BuildQuery</b> method that constructs the query and outputs it as a
        string. Along with these, they each have multiple methods that return a reference to the object itself. These
        methods have different purposes in building the body of the query and the reason for returning the object
        reference is so that they can be chained together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The methods present in a QueryBuilder class are many and that because of the presence of overloads and
        different iterations of methods so that we could handle multiple cases as to how an another person might want to
        use this library. Let us take the <b>AddTriple</b> method for example, present in the class that handles select
        queries. A triple may be added directly as a string or by specifying each element of the triple separately
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          public IQueryBuilder AddTriple(string subject, string prefix, string predicate, string obj);
          public IQueryBuilder AddTriple(string triple);
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In case that we may want to insert multiple triples that make use of the same subject, we may specify the
        subject first by using the <b>UseSubject</b> method and then use another overload of the AddTriple methods that
        takes just the predicate and the object as parameters.
