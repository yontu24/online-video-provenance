    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains instructions in regard to the use of the solution provided. We will present a few use cases
      for our application and also talk about how the client works and interacts with two of our services, namely the
      Search Service and the Recommendation Service.A brief explication about the use of the Query builder library will
      also be provided towards the end of the document.

    <h2>Use cases/ User stories</h2>
    <h4>Use case I</h4>
    <p>
      Ion Ionut Ionescu is a young man who likes watching movies. He recently found out about our OVI application and
      decided to give it a try in order to find out more informations about a movie that he heard about.
    </p>
    <p>
      He navigates to our application, clicks on the searchbar on the first page, and realizes he does not remember the
      full title, so he types in the part that he remembers, "the blue orange". He clicks the search button and gets
      sent to a page where he briefly sees "Searching for movies on dbpedia..." (because we didn't have the movie in our
      dataset, and we looked for it on dbpedia, but Ion doesn't know that) after which he sees "Movies found :" and
      under that heading a movie title, "Tintin and the Blue Oranges". He clicks on the title and gets sent to a page
      where he can see all the details gathered about that movie. He can see that it was written by Herge and Rene
      Goscinny, produced by Robert Laffont , the runtime is 105 minutes and many other informations. Ion is happy.
    </p>
    <h4>Use case II</h4>
    <p>
      Ion wants to find out more about an actor from The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. So he goes to our
      application, types in the movie title in the search bar, clicks on the title from the search result, and is
      redirected to the page with information about the movie he searched for. He sees Ian Holm's name, the actor he
      wants to know more about, so he clicks on it. He is redirected to a page where he can see a list of triples, and
      notices Ian's name is in every one of them (P.S Ion was a student at FII so he knows the things he is looking at
      are RDF triples). At the moment Ion Ionut Ionescu cannot see any personal information about Ian Holm in those
      triples, but he can see the 'populate data about the person' so he clicks on it. He is sent back to the search
      page after being notified that the person has been updated so he navigates back to Ian Holm's page and now he can
      see from the list of triples that Ian's nationality is British, he has 5 children, his birth place is in Essex,
      Goodmayes and that his birthYear is 1931. Ion is once again happy.
    </p>
    <h4>Use case III</h4>
    <p>
      Nowadays Ionut Ionescu has been watching action movies. He recently watched 'Ready player one' and he would want
      to see some simmilar movie. He comes to our application once again, searches for the movie he watched, goes to its
      informations page and clicks the button 'Recommendation' and now he can see a list of movies (that have at least
      one of the genres, actors, or directors in common with the movie he searched for, but again, he doesn't know
      that).
      He clicks on the first title, 'Transformers: The last Knight' to see some details about it. It was exactly what he
      was looking for. Ion Ionut Ionescu is happier than ever and hopes that the three guys who made this application
      will get a good grade for it.

  <section id="client">
    <h2>Client functionality and Search Service calls</h2>
    <p>
      The client consists of an application developed in <a href="">AngularJS</a>. It has six main components and it
      mainly interacts with the Search Service, but also with the Recommendation Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the front-page, the user is able to search for titles in our dataset by entering a string into the search bar.
      When pressing the search button, a request is made to the "/movies/titles/{title}" endpoint of the Search Service.
      This will return a list of all movies that contain the input string in their title, along with their URI.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user can choose any of the returned titles by clicking on them, which will send another request to the Search
      Service, this time on the "/movies/data/{movieUri}" endpoint, using the URI out of the pair previously returned by
      the other endpoint. This will return all information in our dataset regarding the concerned movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case that we do not have the desired movie in our dataset, the we may search for it in an external source, <a
        href="">DBpedia</a> and we will pull the information from there on the spot, by making use of the
      "/dbpedia/movies/{title}" endpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same page where the movie info is displayed, recommendations will also be placed for the user to see. These
      will be returned by a call to the "/recommendation" endpoint of the Recommendation Service, where the information
      will be sent as a query string. If the user clicks one of the recommendations, they will be taken to the info page
      for the respective movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user clicks on a person's name, then a request will be made to the "/dbpedia/persons/{name}" endpoint of
      the Search Service, which will pull the person's information from dbpedia and then display it for the user to see
      in a new page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionaly, if the user clicks on another property that contains a link, aside from person names, they will be
      taken to a page that will display all triples that the current property is part of. This information is provided
      by the "/resources/{resourceUri}" endpoint of the Search Service.
    </p>

  <section id="queryBuilderLibrary">
    <h2>Query Builder Library</h2>
    <p>
      The library was developed in order to facilitate the process of writing SPARQL queries and to get rid of the need
      to store them as they are in plaintext or strings. To this extent, we have implemented classes that handle
      building SELECT and INSERT queries. In the following paragraphs, the use of the builder for SELECT queries will be
      briefly described.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first we only had in plan to handle SELECT queries and although we later tried handling another case, the name
      for it remained QueryBuilder. Put in simple terms, the way to use it is to instantiate the class by using its only
      constructor, which takes no parameters and then you may call and chain methods together in order to build your
      desired query.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be able to build a query, we split it into 3 parts:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        What comes before the where clause: prefix declaration and specifying the variables that will hold the returned.
        values
      </li>
      <li>
        The where clause: everything that exists between the brackets followed by the WHERE keyword.
      </li>
      <li>
        What comes after the where clause: grouping and limit.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The methods that handle the parts before and after the where clause are quite simple to use. The AddSubject
      methods specify the variables to be returned and the AddAggregatedSubject method allows the user to perform a
      GROUP_CONCAT over the variable to be returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most complex part is constructing the body of the where clause. The most important method to take notice of
      here is this overload of the AddTriple method:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        public IQueryBuilder AddTriple(string subject, string prefix, string predicate, string obj)
        {
            _whereBody.AppendLine($"?{subject} {prefix}:{predicate} ?{obj} .");

            return this;
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In the code snipped above we can observe how a triple is defined in our query builder. The subject will always be
      a variable and while the object, in this case, is also one, the AddTripleWithLiteral methods handle the cases
      when, as it is implied, the object is a literal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since often we would use multiple triples that have the same subject and are from the same graph, meaning that we
      have the same prefix, an user may specify those two in advance, by using the UseSubject and UsePrefix methods.
      They values given will be stored internally and the user may use overloads of the AddTriple method to only specify
      the elements that differ from one triple to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the cases where our format described in the snipped above does not match what the user wants to insert, he may
      use and overload of the AddTriple method that receives only one string and input the construct that he needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get the final product, that is the query, the BuildQuery method may be used. All previously declared constructs
      such as prefixes, variables and triples are stored internally and are assembled in the shape of the query inside
      this method. As such, as long as all proper calls are made, meaning that no variable used to build the query is
      left empty, the order of the calls does not matter.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        QueryBuilder queryBuilder = new QueryBuilder();
        queryBuilder
           .AddDistinctSubject("person")
           .WithSubjectOfType("dbo", "Person")
           .UsePrefix("dbp")
           .AddTriple("name", "name")
           .AddFilter($" ?person = <{uri}> ")
           .AddLimit(10);

        string query = queryBuilder.BuildQuery();
      </code>
    </pre>
