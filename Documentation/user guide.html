      This document contains instructions regarding to the use of the solution provided. The inteded usage for the
      client can be found here, along with the usage for the Search Service and the Query Builder Library.

    <h2>Client usage</h2>
    <p>
      The client consists of an application developed in <a href="">AngularJS</a>. It has five main components and it
      mainly interacts with the Search Service and also with the Recommendation Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the front-page, the user is able to search for titles in our dataset by entering a string into the search bar.
      When pressing the search button, a request is made to the "/movies/titles/{title}" endpoint of the Search Service.
      This will return a list of all movies that contain the input string in their title.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user can choose any of the returned titles by clicking on them, which will send another request to the Search
      Service, this time on the "/movies/data/{movieUri}" endpoint. This will return all information in our dataset
      regarding the concerned movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case that we do not have the desired movie in our dataset, the we may search for it in an external source, <a
        href="">DBpedia</a> and we will pull the information from there on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same page, recommendations will be displayed for the user to see. These will
      be returned by a call to the "/recommendation" endpoint of the Recommendation Service, where the information will
      be sent as a query string. If the user clicks one of the recommendations, they will be taken to the info page for
      the respective movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user clicks on a person's name, then a request will be made to the "/dbpedia/persons/{name}" endpoint of
      the Search Service, which will pull the person's information from dbpedia and then display it for the user to see
      in a new page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionaly, if the user clicks on another property that contains a link, aside from person names, they will be
      taken to a page that will display all triples that the current property is part of.
